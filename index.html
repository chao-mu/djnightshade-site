        <meta property="og:description" content="Nightshade started serving up drum n bass on vinyl in 1999, amidst a budding NYC bass culture, before transitioning to digital DJing. Since then, this esteemed lady of bass has performed at massive events coast to coast, including Warped Tour, Whistle, Candyball, and Burning Man, as well as festivals and weeklies like Firefly, Therapy, and Elements. She has been guest featured on DNB Radio, Kind Radio, State of the Art, Bass Movement, and Radio Ninja. Inspired by deep bass, eastern scales, and curious vocals, she remains anchored to her love for versatile and stomp-worthy drum n bass. Professor by day and currently based in Boston, Nightshade continues to deliver her unique mix of dark rolling basslines and melodic grooves to the dancefloor carnivores.">
